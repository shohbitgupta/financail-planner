```
7. GOAL RISKS AND MITIGATION
For each major goal (retirement, wealth building, etc.), provide:
- Goal Name: [Goal Name]
- Potential Risks: List 3-4 specific risks as bullet points

8. ADDITIONAL ADVICE
Provide 4-6 specific, actionable pieces of financial advice as bullet points:
- Tax optimization strategies
- Emergency fund recommendations

```

#### Smart Parsing Functions:
- `parse_goal_risks_mitigation()`: Extracts structured goal risks from LLM
